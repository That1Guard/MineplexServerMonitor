# Mineplex Server Monitor Shell Scripts
These are experimental and are not guarenteed to work.
IMPORTANT: YOU NEED AT LEAST BASIC KNOWLEDGE ON SHELL SCRIPTS TO MAKE THESE WORK!

## Depends
* Basic Shell Script knowledge
* Linux or Mac (Windows Linux Subsystems should work)

## Setup
* Go into [easyRemoteStartServerCustom.sh](easyRemoteStartServerCustom.sh) and change ```pathToServer``` to the path to where your servers are w/ the ```$9``` at the end.
* Within lines 68-89 change the paths to the plugins as well as the maps.
* Go into [easyRemoteKillServer.sh](easyRemoteKillServer.sh) and change ```pathToServer``` to the path to where your servers are w/ the ```$2``` at the end.
* Go into your ServerMonitor source and change the paths to the shell scripts to where ever you cloned your scripts to be at.
* You should be all set!
